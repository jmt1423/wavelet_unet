I have finished writing the project specification, I know its a bit late however
I saw no submission on moodle so I assume this is just turned in with the final
project at the end?

* I am happy to change anything you think is needed in this project
  specification.

* I attempted to nail a scope down that I thought was reasonable, however if you
  think otherwise I am happy to change scopes.

* Maybe the methodology section could be improved?

* So as I researched more into some of these methods and techniques, I started
  to think that this was a soil coverage classification issue which is why I
  decided to talk about why it is needed and how these technologies can help.
